		Forget about n00bs stealing your CLEO scripts, use this tool to encrypt your files.
	
		Other CLEO encryptors are broken an useless, use this tool to break popular encryption algorithms.
	
	Features:
	
		Secure encryption algorithm. Oh, did I mention this tool is the best (hands down) CLEO encryptor? I did... and I said it again.
	
		Custom message. Add your text (up to 6kB), multi-line message supported.
		
		Protection against tampering. What's worse than stolen source code? Correct, it's stolen authorship. Not gonna happen though, modified
		files refuse to work.
	
		Password protection. You heard it right! It is optional, but you can protect your CLEO scripts with a password. Which means you can
		retrieve source code of your script using your secret phrase. When script encrypted without a password, source code is not retrievable.
	
		General file encryptor. Okay, I will say this... you can use this tool to encrypt files other than CLEO scripts, in which case
		password is mandatory. Although keep in mind, this tool does not necessarily comply with "safety standards of cryptography",
		use at your own risk. Huge files supported.
	
		Decryption. Every other CLEO encryptor is broken and useless, trust me on this. This functionality allows you to break
		popular encryption algorithms (MogAika, FYP, blackjesus etc.). Some scripts may not decrypt, show them to me! Will decrypt on the next release.
	
	Usage:
	
		Place decryptor.cleo in CLEO folder. This file mandatory when running encrypted scripts, otherwise game will crash.
		Open *.bat files for further usage information.
		Opcode 0x0FF0 reserved.

	Got issues? Text here, will take a look.
